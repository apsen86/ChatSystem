# ChatSupport System - Complete Implementation

## Quick Start

Get the system running:

```bash
dotnet run --project ChatSupport.API
```

Once it's up, open your browser and go to the root URL. It redirects to Swagger UI where you can test all the endpoints:

**http://localhost:60635** or **https://localhost:60634**

## System Overview

This is a chat support system that handles user-initiated support requests through API endpoints. The system implements:

- **FIFO queue management** with automatic agent assignment
- **Round-robin assignment** preferring junior agents first
- **Session monitoring** with automatic timeout after 3 missed polls
- **Overflow team activation** during business hours when main teams are full
- **Chat refusal** when all queues reach capacity

## Core Business Requirements Implementation

### 1. User-Initiated Support Requests
A user initiates a support request through the API endpoint that creates and queues a chat session.

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/Chat/create`
**Request**: `{"userId": "12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789abc"}`
**Response**: Session ID, status, and acceptance confirmation

### 2. FIFO Queue and Monitoring
Once a chat session is created, it is put in an FIFO queue and monitored. The system automatically assigns agents using round-robin scheduling.

### 3. Queue Capacity Management
- When session queue is full, unless it's during office hours and overflow is available, the chat is refused
- Same rules apply for overflow; once full, the chat is refused
- Maximum queue length = team capacity × 1.5

### 4. Session Polling and Timeout
- Once the chat window receives OK response, it should poll every 1 second using `POST /api/Chat/{sessionId}/poll`
- A monitor watches the queue and marks a session inactive once it has not received 3 poll requests
- Agents become available for new assignments when sessions timeout

## Team Configuration

### Shift Management
- Agents work 3 shifts of 8 hours each
- When a shift ends, agents finish current chats but get no new assignments
- Capacity = number of agents × their seniority multiplier × 10 (rounded down)

### Team Setup and Capacities

**Team A**: 1 Team Lead + 2 Mid-Level + 1 Junior = **21 chat capacity**
- Team Lead: 1 × 10 × 0.5 = 5
- Mid-Level: 2 × 10 × 0.6 = 12  
- Junior: 1 × 10 × 0.4 = 4
- **Queue limit**: 31 (21 × 1.5)

**Team B**: 1 Senior + 1 Mid-Level + 2 Junior = **22 chat capacity**
- Senior: 1 × 10 × 0.8 = 8
- Mid-Level: 1 × 10 × 0.6 = 6
- Junior: 2 × 10 × 0.4 = 8
- **Queue limit**: 33 (22 × 1.5)

**Team C**: 2 Mid-Level (night shift) = **12 chat capacity**
- Mid-Level: 2 × 10 × 0.6 = 12
- **Queue limit**: 18 (12 × 1.5)

**Overflow Team**: 6 Junior-level agents = **24 chat capacity**
- All considered Junior: 6 × 10 × 0.4 = 24
- **Queue limit**: 36 (24 × 1.5)
- Activates only during office hours (M-F 9-5 EST)

### Seniority Multipliers
- **Junior**: 0.4 (max 4 concurrent chats)
- **Mid-Level**: 0.6 (max 6 concurrent chats)
- **Senior**: 0.8 (max 8 concurrent chats)  
- **Team Lead**: 0.5 (max 5 concurrent chats)

## Chat Assignment Rules

Chats are assigned in round-robin fashion, preferring to assign the junior first, then mid, then senior. This ensures higher seniority agents are available to assist lower levels.

### Assignment Examples

**Example 1**: Team with 1 Senior (cap 8) + 1 Junior (cap 4), 5 chats arrive
- **Result**: 4 chats to junior, 1 to senior

**Example 2**: Team with 2 Junior + 1 Mid-Level, 6 chats arrive  
- **Result**: 3 chats each to juniors, none to mid-level

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `POST /api/Chat/create` - Create and queue chat session
- `POST /api/Chat/{sessionId}/poll` - Poll session to keep it active
- `GET /api/Chat/health` - System health and capacity status

### Admin Endpoints  
- `GET /api/Chat/admin/sessions` - View all sessions (active, queued, inactive)

## Testing the System

### 1. Create Chat Sessions
```bash
# PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://localhost:60634/api/Chat/create" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"userId":"12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789abc"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "sessionId": "d3ddd17a-89b4-48e2-8488-16f3b3447317",
  "status": "Queued",
  "message": "Chat session created successfully",
  "isAccepted": true
}
```

### 2. Poll Session to Keep Active
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://localhost:60634/api/Chat/{sessionId}/poll" -Method POST
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "sessionId": "d3ddd17a-89b4-48e2-8488-16f3b3447317",
  "success": true,
  "message": "Poll successful",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-09T20:39:11.0055391Z"
}
```

### 3. Check System Health
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://localhost:60634/api/Chat/health" -Method GET
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "isHealthy": true,
  "canAcceptNewChats": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-09T20:40:00.8565516Z"
}
```

### 4. Monitor Sessions (Admin)
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://localhost:60634/api/Chat/admin/sessions" -Method GET
```

Shows all sessions with their status, assigned agents, and timestamps.

## Verified Functionality

✅ **FIFO Queue Management**: Sessions processed in creation order
✅ **Round-Robin Assignment**: Junior-first assignment with proper rotation  
✅ **Capacity Calculations**: All team capacities match specified formulas
✅ **Session Timeout**: Automatic cleanup after 3 missed polls
✅ **Agent Assignment**: Automatic assignment with proper logging
✅ **Overflow Handling**: Overflow team activation during business hours
✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Users cannot create multiple active sessions
✅ **Health Monitoring**: System status and capacity tracking

## Console Output Examples

When running the system, you'll see logs like:
```
info: Creating chat session for user 12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789abc
info: Session d3ddd17a-89b4-48e2-8488-16f3b3447317 assigned to agent Jack Anderson (MidLevel)
info: Batch processing completed: 1/1 assignments successful
warn: Session d3ddd17a-89b4-48e2-8488-16f3b3447317 marked inactive due to 3 missed polls
```

## Unit Tests

Run the complete test suite:
```bash
